# 🛡️ Incident Analysis: SYN Flood & IP Spoofing Attack

This repository documents the technical analysis and resolution of a cybersecurity incident that impacted the availability of a corporate web server.

## 📝 Scenario Overview
An automated monitoring alert was triggered due to a **Connection Timeout** error on the company's web server (`192.0.2.1`). Initial investigation revealed that the server was overwhelmed by an unusual volume of TCP traffic, preventing legitimate users and employees from accessing sales promotions.

## 🔍 Technical Diagnosis
After inspecting network logs using Wireshark, a **SYN Flood** attack was identified. The attacker exploited the TCP protocol mechanics as follows:

1. **Massive SYN Requests**: The source flooded the destination with connection requests.
2. **Half-Open Connections**: The server responded with `SYN-ACK`, but the attacker never sent the final `ACK`. This left connections "half-open," consuming the server's memory resources.
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: The server's backlog reached capacity, leading to `HTTP 504 Gateway Time-out` errors and `[RST, ACK]` reset packets as the server struggled to protect itself.



## 🛠️ Mitigation & Response
To restore service and harden the infrastructure, the following actions were taken:
* **IP Blocking**: Identified and blocked the persistent attacking IP `203.0.113.0` in the firewall once the initial spoofing ceased.
* **Firewall Rate Limiting**: Configured limits on the number of simultaneous "half-open" connections allowed.
* **SYN Cookies**: Recommended enabling SYN Cookies to validate connections without pre-allocating memory resources.
